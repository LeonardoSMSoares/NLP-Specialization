    "You will use the `Sequential` model using some `GRU` layers. You should already be familiar with the sequential model and with the Dense layers. In addition, you will use GRU layers in this notebook. Below you can find some links to the documentation and a short description.\n",
    "   - [`Sequential`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model) A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.\n",
    "   - [`Dense`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) A regular fully connected layer\n",
    "   - [`GRU`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/GRU) The GRU (gated recurrent unit) layer. The hidden state dimension should be specified (the syntax is the same as for `Dense`). By default it does not return a sequence, but only the output of the last unit. If you want to stack two consecutive GRU layers, you need the first one to output a sequence, which you can achieve by setting the parameter `return_sequences` to True. If you are further interested in similar layers, you can also check out the [`RNN`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/RNN), [`LSTM`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM) and [`Bidirectional`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Bidirectional). If you want to use a RNN or LSTM instead of GRU in the code below, simply change the layer name, no other change in the syntax is needed.\n",
